<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Zanele Zwane. I graduated from the University of Johannesburg with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Graphic Design. 
  Now, I am looking for my first full-time job. I have been working as a freelance graphic designer for the last three years. 
  I recently started a web development short course on Udemy to upskill myself and strengthen my skills as a designer venturing
  into web development. I cannot say with 100% confidence where I see myself in five years or what my big career goal is because the world is changing rapidly, 
  and I don't have enough professional experience to be certain about such things. However, I know that I can provide a fresh 
  take and an extraordinary approach to every project. I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am 
  open-minded and learn new things quickly. I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop 
  high-quality and unique products.</p>
