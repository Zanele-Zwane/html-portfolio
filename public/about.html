<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Zanele Zwane. I graduated from the University of Johannesburg with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Graphic Design. 
  Now, I am looking for my first full-time job as back-end wed developer. I have been working as a freelance graphic designer 
  for the last three years. I recently started a web development short course on Udemy to upskill myself and strengthen my 
  skills as a designer venturing into web development. I cannot say with 100% confidence where I see myself in five years 
  or what my big career goal is because the world is changing rapidly, and I don't have enough professional experience to 
  be certain about such things. However, I know that I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every 
  project. I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly. I want 
  to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products.</p>
